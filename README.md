notes:
- if you want to debug pytorch code, that uses DataLoader in pycharm: then as described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39371676/debugger-times-out-at-collecting-data/51833034#51833034) you need to go to settings -> python debugger -> enable gevent compatible; otherwise, debug will hang on for forever
